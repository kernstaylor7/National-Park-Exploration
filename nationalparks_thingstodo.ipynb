King salmon may be taken, but they are extremely rare to find in the river. Other salmon species, which are also rare, are closed to fishing within the park’s established Indian River boundaries.<br /> <br /> Please ensure if you do choose to fish, that you follow all state regulations for legal methods of capture, as well as the current state catch and size limits of various species, which are subject to change. All state regulations apply to fishing in the tidal flat area of the park as well.<br /> <br /> All people fishing who are over the age of 16 need an Alaska state fishing license and need to carry it with them while fishing, or while intending to fish. If you are intending to fish for king salmon, are a resident over the age of 18 or a non-residents over the age of 16, you will need a separate stamp. Law enforcement may check both licenses and equipment. For more information on Alaska state fishing license requirements and options please go to\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main\">Alaska Department of Fish & Game\\'s website</a>.<br /> <br /> Fishing remains an ongoing tradition, a part of life in Sitka since people have inhabited the area. Please fish responsibly, following the established regulations and with a license when necessary.',\n",

For example, bumblebees can fly when temperatures are low, so they are out when other insects are too cold.

When they spawn, or swim upriver to mate and lay eggs, they are very easy to observe. Humans are not the only animals eagerly awaiting their arrival! Bears, eagles, and others check periodically for salmon and gorge on them when they appear. If you visit to watch salmon spawn, be aware and courteous toward other wildlife. Know <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bears/safety.htm\">what to do if you observe a bear</a>.<br /> <br /> Because salmon are so important, you can find them on many of the totem poles and ceremonial objects in and around the visitor center.<br /> <br /> If you plan to fish in the park, learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/sitk-fishing.htm\">fishing rules and regulations</a>.</p>',\n",

The road accessible waters of the Park and Preserve are located in the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna Management Area and in the Upper Tanana River Management Area, both are in the Interior Region. Additional waters in more remote locations are found in the Yakutat Management Area of the Southeast Region and in waters near the US/Canadian border of the Yukon Management Area of the Interior Region.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I catch salmon?</strong><br /> There are not very many good opportunities to catch salmon in the road accessible areas within the park. The Copper River tends to be too silty to catch salmon. The best places to sport fish for Chinook Salmon (kings) and Sockeye Salmon (reds) are the nearby Klutina and Gulkana Rivers. The best place to catch Coho Salmon (silvers) and Pink Salmon (humpbacks or humpies) is outside of the park in Valdez, AK. Occasionally, some lakes are stocked with hatchery raised Coho Salmon (silvers). Contact the\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingSport.main\">Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game</a>\\xa0for more information on stocked lakes.<br /> <br /> <strong>What kind of salmon are in the park?</strong><br /> All five species of Pacific salmon that are native to Alaska are found within the park: Sockeye Salmon (reds), Chinook Salmon (kings), and Coho Salmon (silvers) are found throughout much of the park. Pink Salmon (humpbacks or humpies) and Chum Salmon (dogs or calicos) can be found in the Yakutat area. Kokanee are found in Copper Lake.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are kokanee?</strong><br /> Kokanee are a life-history variant of Sockeye Salmon that complete their entire life cycle in fresh water. Pacific salmon normally spawn and hatch in fresh water, go to the ocean for 1-5 years, and return to fresh water to complete their life cycle before dying after they spawn.<br /> <br /> <strong>What other types of fish are in the park?</strong><br /> Lake Trout, Dolly Varden, Rainbow Trout/steelhead, Burbot, Arctic Grayling, Northern Pike, Threespine Stickleback, Longnose Sucker, Lake Chub, Pacific Lamprey, Starry Flounder, and various species of whitefish, smelt, and sculpin.<br /> <br /> <strong>What is the difference between a Hooligan and a Eulachon?</strong><br /> There is no difference – they are the same fish, but with two different names. They are a member of the smelt family.<br /> <br /> <strong>What kind of fish are stocked in the park?</strong><br /> The National Park Service does not stock any fish in the Park. The State of Alaska had once stocked Rainbow Trout, Arctic Grayling, Lake Trout, and Coho Salmon (silvers) in some waters that are now in the Park. Stocking typically occurs in landlocked lakes, where they’re not able to go to the ocean or migrate to other waterbodies. The landlocked salmon mature for 2-5 years and die just like their ocean-going relatives. Landlocked Coho Salmon don’t generally spawn successfully.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I catch Rainbow Trout?</strong><br /> Silver, Sculpin, Strelna, 2-Mile, 3-Mile, and Pippin lakes are stocked by the State with Rainbow Trout. Wild stocks of Rainbow Trout are found in the Tebay Lakes and the Hanagita River, along with other tributaries of the Chitina River. They are also found in the nearby Gulkana River, which is considered the northern-most population of Rainbow Trout in the North American continent. Steelhead can be found in many of these waters.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are steelhead?</strong><br /> Steelhead are a life history variant of Rainbow Trout that goes to the ocean to spend a part of their life and return to freshwater (anadromous), much like salmon. However, they don’t die after they spawn.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are the worms in some of the fish? Are those worms dangerous? Can we get worms in our system from eating the fish?</strong><br /> Worms found in local fish are likely a species of round or tape worm. When cooked properly, there is a low likelihood of worms found in fish causing health issues in people. It is advised to not eat raw fish.<br /> <br /> <strong>Can I go dip netting for salmon?</strong><br /> Only Alaska residents may dip net for salmon. Under State regulations, any Alaska resident can choose to either dip net in the Chitina Subdistrict Personal Use fishery or in the Glennallen Subdistrict Subsistence fishery. You must have a permit; there is a fee for the Personal Use dip net permit, but the subsistence permit is free. To dip net under Federal Subsistence regulations, one must be a resident of Alaska and have their primary, permanent residence located in a rural area specifically designated (by the Federal Subsistence Board) as qualifying for the fishery (see\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/subsistence/fisheries\">Federal Subsistence Fishing Regulations</a>). A Federal Subsistence Fishing permit is required; this permit is free. To be considered a rural Alaska resident, you must have maintained a primary, permanent place of residence in a rural area and lived in Alaska for the previous 12 months. Having a seasonal residence in a rural area does not qualify you as a rural resident.<br /> <br /> <strong>Can I operate or use a fishwheel?</strong><br /> Like with dip netting, you may operate or use a fishwheel only if you are a resident of Alaska and have a subsistence fishing permit. This can be done with either a State or a Federal permit, with similar qualifications as listed above for dip netting.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are the sport fishing harvest limits for fish in the Upper Copper – Upper Susitna River Management Area?</strong><br /> The General Regulations for the Upper Copper/Upper Susitna Management Area allow harvest limits as listed below. However, consult with the ADFG Sport Fish Office in Glennallen or the State Sport Fishing Regulations for additional details for specific waters.<br /> Chinook Salmon (kings) - 20 inches or longer- Annual limit of 4, 1 per day, 1 in possession<br /> Less than 20 inches- 10 per day, 10 in possession<br /> Other salmon- 16 inches or longer- 3 per day, 3 in possession<br /> Less than 16 inches- 10 per day, 10 in possession<br /> Dolly Varden- 10 per day, 10 in possession<br /> Lake Trout- 2 per day, 2 in possession<br /> Rainbow Trout/steelhead- Note: some waters are closed to retention<br /> Other waters: 2 per day, 2 in possession, only 1 of which may be 20 inches or longer<br /> Arctic Grayling- 5 per day, 5 in possession<br /> Burbot- 5 per day, 5 in possession<br /> For Stocked Waters- combination of species- 10 per day, 10 in possession, only 1 of which may be 18 inches or longer<br /> <br /> <strong>When will salmon be in the streams and when do they spawn?</strong><br /> • Sockeye Salmon (reds): arrive in the upper Copper River between late-May and August and spawn in streams and lakes mostly between August and September.<br /> • Chinook Salmon (kings): arrive in the upper Copper River between late-May and July and spawn in rivers mostly during July and August.<br /> • Coho Salmon (silvers): arrive in the upper Copper River from early-August to late-September and spawn from late-September to November.<br /> For fish counts throughout the State, check here:\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/FishCounts/\">https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/FishCounts/</a><br /> <br /> <strong>What should I use for flies, lures, or bait to catch fish*?</strong><br /> • Dolly Varden: preserved fish roe, corn, flies, or small lures<br /> • Arctic Grayling: preserved fish roe, corn, flies, or small lures<br /> • Rainbow Trout/steelhead: flies or lures<br /> • Lake Trout: lures<br /> • Chinook Salmon (kings): preserved salmon roe clusters, lures, or flies<br /> • Sockeye Salmon (reds): streamer flies<br /> • Coho Salmon (silvers): lures or streamer flies<br /> • Burbot: bait such as whitefish flesh<br /> <br /> <u>* In NPS waters, any fish parts used as bait must be of native species, you may not “chum” by placing bait in the water to attract fish, and Sport Fishing can only be done by hook and line, with the rod or line being closely attended (no set lines). Reference the most recent version of the ADFG Sport Fishing Regulations Summary for general gear and bait restrictions under State regulations.</u><br /> <br /> <strong>When do steelhead spawn?</strong><br /> In the Copper River drainage, adult steelhead typically come up in the fall and lay over until the spring. Then they spawn in early summer and the adults return to the ocean. In other areas they come up in the spring, then spawn and return to the ocean.<br /> <br /> <strong>How many salmon come up in the Copper River each year?</strong><br /> The Miles Lake Sonar is used in the lower Copper River to estimate the number of salmon migrating upstream each year. Based on this sonar data, the average in-river return for the past 30 years is 850,000 salmon. Find current sonar salmon passage estimates of the Miles Lake Sonar via the AK Dept. of Fish and Game at:\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareacopperriver.salmon_escapement\">https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareacopperriver.salmon_escapement</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Are there any places I can’t fish?</strong><br /> All lakes and streams within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve are open to sport fishing, unless they are on private property.

Some species and some waters may have different seasons, and some regulations may vary for different management areas; consult the State ADFG Sport Regulation Brochure for the area of interest.<br /> <br /> <strong>How big do local species of fish get?</strong><br /> <em>(inches \", pounds lbs.)</em><br /> • Arctic Grayling: up to 17” – generally 9-12”<br /> • Lake Trout: up to 20 lbs. – generally 1-8 lbs.<br /> • Rainbow Trout: up to 22” – generally 10-18”<br /> • Steelhead: up to 32” – Average 26”<br /> • Chinook (king) Salmon: up to 45 lbs.<br /> • Sockeye (red) Salmon: up to 8 lbs.<br /> • Coho (silver) Salmon: up to 12 lbs<br /> • Burbot: up to 20 lbs. – Average 1 to 6 lbs.<br /> • Dolly Varden: generally 6-14”<br /> • Landlocked Coho Salmon: up to 16” – generally about 12”<br /> <br /> <strong>Are the rivers in this area dangerous?</strong><br /> All of the rivers, especially the larger ones, are dangerous. The water moves fast and is cold; a person cannot last very long in the water. Silt in the rivers causes poor visibility. Exercise extreme caution when fishing Alaskan waters.

The eastern end of South Bluff gradually lowers in elevation, forming isolated prominences of which Dome Rock is the largest. The western end remains at a significant elevation above the prairie. Between Sentinel Rock and Crown Rock is a “gap” referred to as Coyote Pass. Coyote Pass is 4,331 feet above sea level.

A more fluid, \"gray iron\" was also poured into molds to make pots, kettles, skillets, firebacks and salt-pans as a finished product<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/forge.htm\">Forge </a>-\\xa0Most of the iron produced at the furnace was moved over to the forge, where sow bars were converted into wrought iron. A five-hundred pound hammer was used to forge a hot ball of iron into wrought iron \"merchant bars,\" the Saugus works\\' major product. These bars were sold to merchants and blacksmiths for manufacture into finished products such as axes, hammers, hardware, and fireplace tools.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mill.htm\">Rollings and Slitting Mill</a> -\\xa0A number of merchant bars were sheared in half and heated in the furnace, then run through rollers to draw them out. Some of these rolled pieces were shipped as they were, while others were passed back through slitters, reducing them to thin rods. Most were bundled for shipment to Boston and other New England settlements, although the Saugus blacksmith cut some into nails for local use.</p>',\n",

       "   'longDescription': 'Cane River Creole sits in a diverse ecosystem that provides habitat for a wide variety of birds, both resident and migratory. With relatively mild winters, many of these species such as the Northern Cardinal, Mourning Dove, and Blue Jay can be seen year-round, but their numbers increase with migration periods. Others, like the striking Cedar waxwing, are generally only seen in February or early March.<br /> <br /> It is not uncommon to see hundreds of Red-wings or mixed flocks of black birds in the fields or in the trees along the roads in the winter. The Cattle Egret is more often seen following tractors or, as their name implies, cattle and other livestock as they disturb the ground and stir up insects in their paths. Wading birds like the Great Blue Heron and its close kin the White Egret or Heron are common sights along the river. Visitors interested in birding are encouraged to bring binoculars and enjoy the spectacular views of the many birds in the park from a safe distance!',\n",

The level and necessity of the response is determined through evaluation of the situation by field personnel. Rescuer safety is always our first priority. This park expects visitors to exhibit a high degree of self-reliance and responsibility for their own safety in line with the difficulty of their chosen activities.<br /> <br /> If you choose to carry a hand-held electronic signaling device, be familiar with its operation, limitations, and frequency of failure to transmit. Do not rely on it to summon rescue personnel or notify family that you are “OK”. The device only acts as a communication link. All decisions regarding rescue will fall to park field staff. If you do activate the emergency help function on the device, understand the consequences of what you may be asking of rescue personnel.<br /> <br /> If you find yourself in a true emergency and have exhausted all means of self-rescue/help, contact a ranger in the field or call Texas DPS Pecos Dispatch (432) 447-3533. There is little to no cell reception in most areas of the park. When you make contact, provide clear and concise information regarding the nature and exact location of the problem or injury, as well as the number of people involved. Be aware that help may be several hours to several days out. You must be prepared to help yourself.<br /> <br /> If you have any questions, please contact the Visitor Center at (915) 828-3251.</span></p>',\n",
       "   'locationDescription': 'The trail starts at the Pine Springs Trailhead (1/2 mile from the Pine Springs Visitor Center – check in at the visitor center, then turn right out of the visitor center parking lot). Follow the signs for the Guadalupe Peak Trail. Follow the hiker trail; the horse trail will add about 1 extra mile to the trip (although it is less steep).<br /> <br /> You will encounter the steepest part of the hike in the first mile and a half, as the trail switchbacks up the first steep slope. Be sure not to cut across the switchbacks, as this causes accelerated erosion. The views will get better with every switchback you climb.<br /> <br /> After about a mile and a half, the trail will become less steep as it passes a cliff and then turns around to the north-facing slope. Here, hikers will discover a small forest of pinion pine, south-western white pine, and Douglas fir. The forest exists here since on a north-facing slope there is not as much sunlight. The slightly cooler, shadier climate allows these pines to survive.<br /> <br /> After nearly three miles the trail will top out at a false summit. It is still a little more than a mile to the actual summit. The trail will flatten out for a short distance as it passes through a sparse forest of ponderosa pine. The backcountry campsite for overnight backpackers is on this summit (backcountry permit required to camp).<br /> <br /> After passing the backcountry campsite, the trail descends slightly and crosses a wooden bridge. After the bridge, the trail begins the final climb to the summit. After only a few switchbacks, the top of El Capitan will dominate the view to the south. Eventually you will pass the horse hitching posts and arrive at the summit, where on a clear day you will be rewarded with a tremendous view of the surrounding mountains and desert.\\xa0',\n",

Carry a spare tube and tools for minor repairs.</li> <li>Wear high visibility clothing. It sets you apart from the scenery and makes you more visible to motorists.</li> <li>Avoid the parkway during periods of low visibility. Fog and rain may occur unpredictably. Reschedule your trip for better weather or follow lower elevation routes until weather conditions improve.</li> <li>Temperatures vary greatly along the parkway. Wear your clothing in layers.</li> <li>Carry plenty of water and high energy foods. Safe drinking water is available on a seasonal basis in picnic areas, campgrounds, concession operations, and visitor centers. Water from streams and springs is unsafe for drinking unless you purify it.</li> <li>Make an honest evaluation of your abilities before beginning a bicycle trip on the parkway. In some sections, you will climb over one thousand feet in just a few miles.</li> <li>When cycling in a group, adjust your spacing to\\xa0allow motor vehicles to pass safely.</li> <li>Exercise caution whe riding through tunnels. There are 25 tunnels in North Carolina and 1 tunnel in Virginia.\\xa0</li> <li>Carry a first aid kit.</li> <li> <p>Carry some form of identification with you.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Planning Extended Trips</h3> <ul> <li>To assist in planning your trip, consult the\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/blri/planyourvisit/maps.htm\">parkway map</a>\\xa0and\\xa0<em><a href=\"http://www.blueridgeparkway.org/v.php?pg=73\">Blue Ridge Parkway Directory & Travel Planner</a>.</em></li> <li>Some parkway campgrounds and services are located too far apart for convenient cycling.</li> <li>Camping is permitted only at established campgrounds.

But did you know that <strong>YOUR</strong> actions can have a direct and lasting impact on the health and behavior of one of these magnificent animals?\\xa0</p> <h3>A Fed Bear Is A Dead Bear!</h3> <p>A bear's keen sense of smell leads it to insects, nuts and berries, but the animal is also enticed by the tantalizing smells of human food and garbage such as hot dogs, apple cores, and cookies left on the ground in picnic areas, campgrounds, and along trails. Feeding bears or allowing them access to human food and garbage causes a number of problems:</p> <ul> <li>It changes the bear's behavior and causes them to lose their instinctive fear of humans. Over time, these bears may begin approaching people in search of food and may become more unpredictable and dangerous.</li> <li>Bears that obtain human food and garbage may damage property and injure people. These bears pose a risk to public safety. Often, they must be euthanized.</li> <li>Studies have shown that bears that lose their fear of people by obtaining human food and garbage never live as long as bears that feed on natural foods and are shy and afraid of people. Many are hit by cars and become easy targets for poachers.</li> </ul> <p>For these reasons, park rangers issue citations for littering, feeding bears, and for improper food storage. These citations can result in fines of up to $5,000 and jail sentences lasting up to six months.\\xa0</p> <h3>The Biggest Threat to Bears is YOU!</h3> <p>How you behave while in the park has an impact on the safety of bears. Bears that cause property damage or injure humans may have to be euthanized. Please resist the temptation to feed bears. <strong>Remember, a fed bear is a dead bear!</strong>\\xa0<strong>I</strong>f you are careless with your food or litter, or intentionally allow a bear to get too close to you to snap a photo,<strong> YOU may be responsible for a bear's death!</strong></p> <h3>What Can You Do To Protect Bears?</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Do not feed bears or other wildlife.</strong></li> <li><strong>Do not approach within 50 yards or any distance that disturbs a bear.</strong></li> <li><strong>Store all food items.</strong><br /> All food, coolers, utensils, cook stoves and other food items must be stored out of sight in a closed vehicle. Never leave food or coolers unattended (even for a minute!)\\xa0</li> <li><strong>Keep your area clean.</strong><br /> Pick up food scraps and dispose of all garbage, including fruit rinds and cores, in a secure trash can or dumpster. Close the lid after depositing your trash. Do not place trash outside of an overflowing dumpster or trash can.\\xa0</li> <li><strong>Report bear incidents.</strong> <p>If you see another visitor breaking these rules, or encounter a bear in a picnic area or campground,\\xa0or in any other developed area, please call (828) 298-2491 or stop at a Visitor Center to report it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\\xa0</p> <h3>What Do I Do If I See A Bear?</h3> <p>Black bears are wild animals that are dangerous and unpredictable. Although extremely rare, attacks on humans have occurred, inflicting serious injuries and death. Treat bear encounters with extreme caution:\\xa0</p> <ul> <li>Remain watchful.</li> <li>Do not approach a bear. And do not allow it to approach you.</li> <li> <p>If your presence causes the bear to change its behavior (stops feeding, changes its travel direction, watches you, etc.) you are too close. Being too close may promote aggressive behavior from the bear such as running toward you, making loud noises, or swatting the ground. The bear is demanding more space. Don't run, but slowly back away, watching the bear. Increase the distance between you and the bear. The bear will probably do the same.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>If a bear persistently follows or approaches you, without vocalizing, or paw swatting:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Change your direction. If the bear continues to follow you, stand your ground.</li> <li>Act aggressively to intimidate the bear. Talk loudly or shout at it. Throw non-food objects such as rocks at the bear. Use a deterrent such as a stout stick. Act together as a group if you have companions. Make yourselves look as large as possible (for example, move to higher ground).</li> <li>Don't run and don't turn away from the bear.</li> <li> <p>Don't leave food for the bear; this encourages further problems.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>If the bear's behavior indicates that it is after your food and you are physically attacked:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Separate yourself from the food and slowly back away.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>If the bear shows no interest in your food and you are physically attacked, the bear may consider you as prey:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fight back aggressively with any available object!</li> <li> <p>Do not play dead!</p> </li> </ul> <p>Help protect others, report all bear incidents to a park ranger immediately. Above all, keep your distance from bears!</p>\",\n",

It is one of the most significant annual bird migrations and can be experienced from the Blue Ridge Parkway. Be warned, hawk watching can grow into an addictive activity similar to treasure hunting. Observers scan the skies for birds, race other birders to identify the species, and enjoy watching the behaviors and interactions of these magnificent migrants.</p> <p>Parkway overlooks on top of the ridges provide close-up viewing of many species including eagles, hawks, falcons, accipiters, osprey, and vultures. Harvey’s Knob Overlook at milepost 95.3 is a designated location for the area’s annual count.</p> <p>There are many ways to participate in the “Hawk Watch.” You can join the other birders on a whim, or you can prepare in advance to make a day (or week) of it. You may wish to\\xa0research online\\xa0which weeks of the year historically have the greatest diversity of species passing by a particular location OR which week(s) have the highest numbers of a particular species passes by OR which week has the highest total number of birds on the move.

       "   'longDescription': '<p>A mountaintop park may seem an unlikely place to fish, but just the opposite is true. The Blue Ridge Parkway\\xa0protects over 100 miles of streams, many of them small, spring-fed watercourses that rise along the spine of the Blue Ridge. In addition, parkway planners designed 13 artificial lakes along the scenic route\\xa0to enhance the natural beauty of the\\xa0drive. These streams and lakes hold a special interest for anglers wishing pit their skills against native or stocked fish in a mountain environment.\\xa0For additional information on fishing and site specific stream information, please visit the\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/blri/learn/management/compendium-cfr-2-3.htm\">Superintendent\\'s Compendium</a></p> <h3>Licenses and Regulations\\xa0</h3> <p>Fishing is permitted in parkway waters with a valid state fishing license from either North Carolina or Virginia. No special trout stamp or license is needed and persons under age 16 can fish without a license when accompanied by an adult. Only single hook, artificial lures may be used. No fish eggs, minnows or amphibians are allowed. Fishing is not permitted from footbridges, dams or adjacent walls. In trout waters, regulations are posted at the stream bank and are in effect for that stream only. On all parkway waters, fishing is allowed from 30 minutes before sunrise until 30 minutes after sunset. Digging for bait on parkway land is not allowed. Be aware that many streams meander onto U.S. Forest Service or private land and regulations will vary as the jurisdiction changes.</p> <h3>Catch and Release: “Your Future & Theirs”</h3> <p>“Catch and release” fishing is growing in popularity around the world among environmentally sensitive fishermen. The thrill of landing a beautiful fish and releasing it to its native habitat is a rewarding feeling for many anglers. Barbless hooks and minimal handling help ensure that the fish will survive a catch and live to reproduce or provide sport for another day. A photograph of your catch can be just as rewarding as “taking home the kill.” \\xa0Although the law does not require “catch and release” on all streams, the habit is one that will ensure healthy populations of species for future generations.</p> <h3>Species of Fish Found in Parkway Streams and Lakes</h3> <p>Most of the lakes on the Blue Ridge Parkway support warm water species such as bass, bream, or bluegill.\\xa0In parkway streams, a variety of species of trout may be found:</p> <ul> <li>Brown trout have been stocked in eastern streams since the late nineteenth century. These golden colored trout are not native to the Appalachian mountains.</li> <li>Rainbow trout have been stocked in eastern streams as sport fish as well. These beautiful fish with the pink stripe down the side are originally native to the western United States.</li> <li>Brook trout are the only native trout in the southern Appalachians. This small fish with beautiful orange and red markings has survived many changes in its habitat during the centuries that humans have occupied the Blue Ridge. Catching a “Brookie” is an experience that most anglers remember for a lifetime.\\xa0</li> </ul>',\n",
